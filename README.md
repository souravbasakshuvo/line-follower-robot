# Line Follower Robot

## Description
This project involves building a **Line Follower Robot** that autonomously follows a predefined path marked by a line. The robot utilizes [sensors] for line detection and a control system for navigation. 
This robot is typically used in robotics education, competitions, and can be extended with more complex behaviors and algorithms.

## Features
- **Line Following**: The robot can follow a black line on a white surface and vice-versa.
- **Speed Control**: The robot adjusts its speed based on the conditions.
- **Sensor Integration**: IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors

## Technologies Used
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino,
- **Programming Language**: Arduino, C++
- **Sensors**: IR Sensors, Ultrasonic Sensor
- **Motor Driver**: L298N
